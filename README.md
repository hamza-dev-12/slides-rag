Knowledge based application or RAG based application has gained quiet a popularity and has various use-cases according to given requirement. Today, I build a fun project by building a Rag pipeline for academice slides. Usually we tend to study for our examintaion from the slides provided by the teacher ;however, sometimes we have to find something specific in very large slide. Who wants to waste his/her time searching for that right. So I decided to create an easy to use application where person can give path of the pdf-file and can query directly instead of searching in large slides ;additionally, the generated response by large language model also enrich the information which helps to understand more easlily.
